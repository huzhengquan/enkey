Most of us take life for granted. When we are in buoyant health, death is all but unimaginable. We seldom think of it. The days stretch out in an endless vista. So we go about our petty tasks, hardly aware of our listless attitude toward life. / 我们大多数人都把生命看作是理所当然的事情。当我们身强体壮时，死亡真的难以想象，我们很少会考虑到它。日子也似乎永远没有尽头。因此我们总是忙于琐碎的事情，而几乎意识不到我们对生活所表现出来的倦怠。

The same lethargy characterizes the use of all our faculties and senses. Only the deaf appreciate hearing, only the blind realize the manifold blessings that lie in sight. Particularly this observation applies to those who have lost sight and hearing in adult life. But those who have never suffered from impairment of sight or hearing seldom make the fullest use of these blessed faculties. Their eyes and ears take in all sights and sounds hazily, without concentration and appreciation. It is the same old story of not being grateful for what we have until we lose it, of not being conscious of health until we are ill. / 同样的倦怠也表现在我们对自身的机能和意识的运用上。只有丧失听觉的人才能理解听力的重要，只有双目失明的人才了解到视觉的可贵。这样的体会尤其适用于那些在成年阶段才丧失视力或听力的人。但是那些从未因视力或听力受损而遭受苦难的人却很少充分利用这些有幸获得的官能。他们的眼睛和耳朵只是模糊地感受着所有的景物与声音，总是心不在焉，也不心怀感激。正如老话所说，只有当我们失去后才会懂得珍惜，只有当我们生病时才会意识到健康的可贵。

I have often thought it would be a blessing if each human being were stricken blind and deaf for a few days during his early adult life. Darkness would make him more appreciative of sight; silence would teach him the joys of sound. / 我常常想，如果每个人在刚刚步入成年阶段时都有几天失明失聪，也可算是一件幸事。黑暗将使他更加感激光明，寂静将告诉他声音的美妙。
