Just for today I will be happy. This has been regarded as a truth what Abraham Lincoln said that, "Most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be." / 就为了今天，我会很快乐。亚伯拉罕·林肯曾说过：“大多数人都是自己决定想怎么快乐就怎么快乐。”这已经被认定是一个真理。

Just for today I will adjust myself to what is, and not try to adjust everything to my own desires. I will take my "luck" when it comes. / 就为了今天，我会调整自己的心态，去适应事物本来的面貌，而不是想方设法令每一件事都符合自己的需求。当“幸运之神”来临时我会抓住它。

Just for today I will try to strengthen my mind. I will study. I will learn something useful. I will not be a mental vagrant. I will read something that requires effort, thought and concentration. / 就为了今天，我会努力充实自己的头脑。我会学习，学一些有用的东西。我不会再做一个精神上的流浪汉。我会读一些需要花费努力和思考，也需要集中注意力的东西。

Just for today I will make a plan. Maybe I will not follow it exactly, but I will have it. I will save myself from two errors: hurry and irresolution. / 就为了今天，我会制订一个计划。或许我不会严格地遵守它，但我一定要有个计划。我要使自己避免犯两种错误：仓促行事和犹豫不决。

Just for today I will have half an hour quietly all by myself and relax. During this half an hour, I will try to get a better perspective of my life. / 就为了今天，我会独自一个人静静地待上半小时来放松自己。在这半小时里，我会对以后的生活有个更好的憧憬。

Just for today I will not be afraid. Especially I will not be afraid to enjoy what is beautiful, and to believe that as I give to the world, so the world will give to me. / 就为了今天，我不会再害怕。尤其我不会再害怕欣赏美丽的事物，并且相信在我给予世界的同时，世界也会给予我。
