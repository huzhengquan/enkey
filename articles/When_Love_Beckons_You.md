level : 2
path : essay|lyric

When love beckons you, follow him, while his ways are hard and steep. When his wings enfold you, bow to him, while the sword hidden among his wings may hurt you. And when he speaks to you, believe in him, while his voice may break your dreams just as the severe north wind may destroy the garden. / 当爱召唤你时，请跟随它，尽管爱的道路充满了艰难险阻。当爱展翅拥抱你时，请依顺它，尽管它隐藏在羽翼中的利剑可能会伤害你。当爱向你倾诉时，请相信它，尽管它的声音可能会打破你的梦想，就如同凛冽的北风会摧毁花园一样。

For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to the height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, so shall he descend to the roots and shake them when they cling to the earth. / 爱会给你戴上王冠，但它也会折磨你。爱会帮助你成长，但它也会为你剪枝。爱会攀升到枝头，爱抚你在阳光下颤动的最柔嫩的枝条，但它也会下落至根部，动摇你牢牢抓住大地的根须。

Love gives nothing but itself and takes nothing but itself. Love possesses not, nor would it be possessed, for love is sufficient to itself. / 除了自身，爱既无所予，亦无所取。爱无法拥有，也不会被拥有，因为爱本身就已足够。

Love has no other desire but to fulfill itself. But if you love and have desires, let these be your desires: / 除了实现自我，爱别无他求。但是如果爱有所求，那就请期待这些吧：

To wake at dawn with cheerful mood and give thanks for another day of loving; / 清晨，带着愉悦的心情醒来，感谢又一个有爱的日子；

To rest at noon and ponder love's ecstasy; / 午休，沉思于爱的心醉神怡里；

To return home at dusk with gratitude; / 黄昏，怀着感激之情回到家中；

And to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips. / 睡前，为你心爱的人儿祈祷，唇间吟唱着赞美的歌。
