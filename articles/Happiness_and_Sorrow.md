level : 2
path : essay|lyric

When love beckons you, follow him, while his ways are hard. The happiness of the material is short-lived, while the happiness achieved by giving others a smile provides a certain level of fulfillment. Peace of mind is the main link to happiness. No mind is happy without peace. Only when we are in sorrow could we realize the true worth of happiness. Sorrow mostly comes from death, failure and despair. But these things are temaporary and will pass away some day. / 物质上的快乐很短暂，然而，当你对他人微笑时所获得的快乐却能赋予你无与伦比的满足。内心的平静与快乐息自己相关。没有平和的心态就无法拥有快乐。只有当我们伤心的时候，我们才能够体会到快乐的真谛。悲伤大多来自于死亡、失败以及绝望。但是这些只是暂时的，总有一天会过去。
