Three pigs are building new houses. The first pig is lazy. He builds his house with straw. The second pig is careless. He builds his house with sticks. The third pig is hard-working. He builds his house carefully with heavy stones. / 三头猪正在建造新房。第一头猪很懒, 他用稻草盖房子。第二头猪是粗心的, 他用棍子盖房子。第三只猪很勤奋, 他用厚重的石头仔细地建造了他的房子。

The Big Bad Wolf comes! "Little pig, little pig, let me in!" he says. "No! I'm afraid," says the lazy pig. "I'll blow your house down!" says the Big Bad Wolf. / 大坏狼来了！ “小猪，小猪，让我进来！”他说。 “不！我很害怕，”懒猪说。 “我会把你的房子吹倒！”大坏狼说。

The wolf blows once, and the straw house falls down. The lazy pig runs to the stick house. / 狼吹了一次，稻草屋倒下了。懒惰的猪跑到棍子屋。

The Big Bad Wolf comes again! "Little pigs, little pigs, let me in!" he says. "No! We're afraid," say the pigs. "I'll blow your house down!" says the Big Bad Wolf. / 大坏狼又来了！ “小猪，小猪，让我进来！”他说。 “不！我们害怕，”猪说。 “我会把你的房子吹倒！”大坏狼说。

He blows once. The house shakes. He blows again, and the stick house falls down. The two pigs run to the stone house. / 他吹了一次。房子震动了。他再次吹，棍子屋倒下了。两头猪跑到石屋里。

The Big Bad Wolf comes again! "Little pigs, little pigs, let me in!" he says. "No!" says the hard-working pig. "I'm not afraid. My house is strong." / 大坏狼又来了！ “小猪，小猪，让我进来！”他说。 “不！”勤劳的猪说, “我不害怕。我的房子很坚固。”

"I'll blow your house down!" says the Big Bad Wolf. He blows once. The house is fine. He blows again and again, but the stone house doesn't fall down. / “我会把你的房子吹倒！”大坏狼说。他吹了一次。房子很好。他一次又一次地吹，但石屋没有倒。

The lazy pig and the careless pig thank the hard-working pig. They decide to build big stone houses, too. / 懒惰的猪和粗心的猪感谢勤劳的猪。他们也决定建造大石屋。
