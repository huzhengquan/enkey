Step One: / 步骤一

Plant yourself deep in the soil of faith, and pack it down solid and tight. Water daily with positive thinking and mulch often with forgiveness, which will help you grow. Quickly remove any seeds of worry, for they will soon sprout. Nourish disappointment with hope whenever it is needed, and always stay cool and shaded when you feel angry or heated. Pinch off guilt or depression, for they create decay, and cultivate with happy memories as often as every day. / 将自己深埋于信念的土壤中，并紧紧的加以固定。每天以积极的思想来浇灌，并经常以宽容来护根，这样会有利于你成长。及时去除烦恼和绝望的种子，因为它们很快就会生根发芽。必要的时候，用希望来滋养失望；当你郁闷兴奋的时候，应保持冷静。修剪掉愧疚和沮丧，因为它们会令你意志衰退。每天都用幸福的回忆来鼓励自己。

Step Two: / 步骤二

Harvest the lessons of the past; just dig, pick, and hoe. And nurture the roots of the present, for now is the time you flourish and grow. Start planting for the future; set your goals in a row. / 挖掘、收割、筛选，从过去收获经验。精心培育现在之根，因为现在正是你旺盛成长的时期。开始制订计划与目标，并着手种植明天。

Step Three: / 步骤三

Remember that grief is a natural predator, so learn to tolerate some damage. Bury the criticism and complaint, for they are injurious pests. Sow the seed of love wherever you may go--for joy, love and laughter are surely bound to grow. / 记住，悲伤是天生的掠夺者，因此要学会容忍灾难。将批评与抱怨埋藏起来，因为它们都是害虫。将爱的种子撒播到你踏过的每一片土地，“快乐”、“爱”与“微笑”一定会滋长蔓延。
