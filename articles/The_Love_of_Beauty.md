The love of beauty is an essential part of all healthy human nature. It is a moral quality. The absence of it may not surely result in condemnation, but the presence of it is an perpetual sign of goodness of heart. The more nobleness and beauty of character will be attained, the more feelings for beauty there will be. / 爱美之心是健全的人性不可或缺的主要部分，它是一种道德品质。缺乏这种道德品质虽然并不一定能会遭受谴责，但是拥有它将会成为美好心灵的永恒标志。品德越是高尚完美，才越能发现美。

Natural beauty is everywhere. The universe is its palace hall. It unfolds into the numberless flowers of spring. It waves in the branches of trees and the green blades of grass. It swims the depths of the earth and the sea. It shines from the strange shell and the precious stone. And not only these minute objects but the oceans, the mountains, the clouds, the stars, the rising and the setting sun -- all overflow with beauty. This beauty is so precious to our tenderest and noblest feelings, that all persons should seek to become acquainted with the beauty in nature. The beauty of the world helps us to seek and find the beauty of goodness in life. / 大自然的美无处不在。宇宙就是它的殿堂。自然之美，呈现在春天万紫千红的鲜花中；摇曳在绿树枝和青草间；傲游在深海幽谷里；闪烁在奇异的贝壳和珍贵的石头中。不只是这些细微的事物，还有海洋、山川、云彩、繁星、太阳的升落 -- 所有事物都洋溢着美。这样的美如此珍贵，撼动着我们最脆弱也最高贵的情感，每个人都应该去感知大自然的美。世界之美将帮助我们寻找并且发现生活中的美。
