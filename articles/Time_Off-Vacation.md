I haven't had a vacation for a while. I think I'll set off soon. I'm not sure where I'll go or what I'll do. But I can learn about that in the tourism place i can go for a long road, breathe fresh air and take some nice pictures. / 我有段时间没有度假了。我想我不久就会出发。我不确定自己要去哪里或者要做什么。但是我知道，在旅游的地方我可以走很长的一段路，呼吸新鲜的空气，并且拍一些漂亮的照片。

When I was a kid, I really looked forward to vacations, because I can spend a free time. But when I became older, I had to pay for my vacations. Planning became important. Time and money are always the big issues. After having a family of my own, vacation is more complicated. / 小的时候，我真的很期待假期，因为我可以度过一段自由的时间。但是当我长大了，我不得不自己支付假期。计划变得很重要，时间和金钱总是个大问题。在我拥有自己的家庭后，度假就变得更为复杂了。

A vacation is supposed to be a time when you get away from work and recharge. It's a time to see something new. It's a time to extend your horizons, especially when you travel. But it's also easy for the opposite to happen. You can come back from a vacation feeling very tired. You can finish a vacation thinking "I can't wait to get back to work." And rather than extend your horizons, you might merely think vacations aren't cheap. I am expecting a really free vacation. / 度假应该是这样的一段时间：你把注意力从工作中转移，并给自己再充电。这是去看一些新事物的一段时间。尤其是当你去旅行时，这就是一段用来开阔视野的时间。但是相反的情况往往很容易发生。当你度假回来后会感觉自己真的很累。你结束一个度假后会思考着：“我等不及要回去工作了。”你并没有想着开阔视野，或许只是思索着度假真的很不便宜。我期待一个真正自由的假期。
