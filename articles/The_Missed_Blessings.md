How many times do we miss blessings just because they are not packaged as we expected? Do not break down what you have by desiring what you have not, but remember that what you have now was once among the things you only hoped for. / 多少次我们与祝福擦肩而过？仅仅因为它们的包装并不像我们所期待的那样。不要再渴望你没有得到的东西而破坏你已经拥有的东西，要记住：你现在所拥有的恰恰就是你曾经唯一渴望得到的。

Sometimes we don't realize the good fortune we have or we could have, just because we expect "the packaging" to be different. What appears as bad fortune may in fact be the door which is just waiting to be opened. Therefore, don't care too much about what the things' packages would be, but see their essence with your bright eyes. / 有时，我们并没有意识到我们已经拥有或原本应该属于我们的好运气，仅仅因为它的外表与我们所期待的有所不同。事实上，表面上看起来的坏运气或许正是等待被开启的幸运之门。因此，不要太过在意事物的包装会是什么样子的，要用雪亮的眼睛看清楚它们的本质。
