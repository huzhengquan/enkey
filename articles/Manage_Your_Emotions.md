What makes me angry? Most often, I hate when someone tries to make others feel bad. l have to admit that, once when l was really angry, I called names. I regretted doing that afterwards, but don't think it's my fault because I was really provoked in that situation. / 什么事情会令我发怒？多数情况下，当有人试图使别人觉得不舒服时，我会感到厌恶。我不得不承认，曾经有一次，我实在很生气，就骂了人。后来，我很后悔那样做，但我不认为那是我的错，因为在那种情况下，我是真的被激怒了。

The most effective way to deal with anger is to talk about the problem. I talk to someone who listens, or I'll write my thoughts down on paper. Learning how to deal with anger is so important when you're growing up. When you're young, you might yell or cry when you're angry, but as you get older, you're expected to handle your emotions much better. / 解决愤怒的最有效的方法就是把问题说出来。我会说给愿意听的人，或者把自己的想法写在纸上。在你成长的过程中，学会如何处理愤怒是非常重要的。当你还是小孩子时，生气了可能会大喊大叫或者哭闹，但当你长大了，你就被期望能够更好地控制自己的情绪。

Learning to control your emotion now will prevent you from doing something that you'll regret later on in life! / 现在就学着控制自己的情绪吧，这样能使你避免做出一些可能会在以后遗憾终生的事情。
