What contributes most to making life worthwhile and costs the least and pays the most, is just a pleasant smile. / 为生命富有价值贡献最多、花费最少却又回报最多的，不过是一个令人舒心的微笑而已。

The smile that comes from the heart which loves its fellows will drive away the clouds of gloom and charm up the sun again. It's full of worth and goodness and blends with manly kindness; it's worth a million dollars, while it doesn't cost a cent. / 因热爱朋友而由衷地发自内心的微笑，会驱走心头的阵阵阴霾，收获一片阳光。它充满了价值与美好，混合着坚毅的仁爱之心；它价值连城却又不花一文。

There is no room for sadness when we see a cheerful smile; it always has the same good look; it's never out of style; it encourages us to try again when failure makes us blue. The dimples of encouragement are good for us. It pays the highest interest -- for it is merely lent. / 当我们看到愉悦的微笑时，忧伤就会消失无踪；它始终面容姣好，却又不落俗套；当失败令我们沮丧时，它鼓励我们再次尝试。鼓励的微笑对于你我都大有好处。它支付的利息高昂无比--只因它仅仅是种借贷形式。

A amile comes very easy -- you can laugh with cheer, but a hundred times before you can force out a salty tear. It ripples out to the heartstrings which will tug, and always leaves an echo that is very like a hug. / 想要微笑很容易--你能愉快地露出百次微笑，却难以挤出一滴眼泪；它的涟漪深深地荡在心弦，总会留下反响，犹如拥抱一般。
