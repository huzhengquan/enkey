Everyone has blue days. There are miserable days when you feel troublesome, ill-tempered, lonely, and even totally exhausted. There are days when you feel small and insignificant, and when everything seems just out of reach. You can hardly pull yourself together and fill yourself with strength to start again. / 每个人都有忧郁的日子。在那些痛苦悲伤的日子里，你会感到自己烦乱无比、脾气暴躁、寂寞难耐，甚至筋疲力尽。在那些日子里，你会感到自己的渺小和微不足道，每件事情似乎都摸不着头脑。你几乎无法振作起来，根本没有力气重新开始。

On blue days you may become a paranoid and always think that everyone is out to get you. This is not always such a bad thing. You feel frustrated and anxious, which can cause you to get into a nail-biting madness and then hopelessly he lost in frenzy to eat three big pieces of chocolate cakes in a blink of an eye! / 在忧郁的日子里，你可能会变成一个偏执狂，总是觉得每个人都想要惹火你。这并不是最糟糕的。你感到受挫失意、担忧焦虑，可能会做出拼命咬指甲的疯狂举动，然后无助地陷入一眨眼就吃掉三大块巧克力蛋糕的疯狂中！

On blue days you feel like you're floating in an ocean of sadness. You're about to burst into tears but don't even know why. Finally, you feel like you're wandering through life without purpose. Oh, what to do, what todo? / 在忧郁的日子里，你会觉得自己漂浮在悲伤的海洋里。你总想大哭一场，却又不知道是为什么。最后，你觉得自己正游戏人间，却毫无目标。唉，该怎么办，该怎么办？
