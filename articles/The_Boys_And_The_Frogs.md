In the pond lived many frogs were much afraid of the boys, for the stones hurt some of the frogs. / 许多生活在水塘里的青蛙非常害怕这些男孩，因为石头曾弄伤了他们中的一些。

At last an old frog lifted his head out of the water and said, "Boys, please don't throw stones at us." / 最后一只老青蛙把他的脑袋探出水面，他说：“孩子们，请别向我们扔石头。”

The boys said, "We are only playing." / 男孩说：“我们只是在玩耍。”

"I know that, but please stop throwing stones, my boys. What is play to you is death to us," said the old frog. / “我知道，但请别扔石头，孩子们。对你们而言的玩耍对我们可意味着死亡。” 老青蛙说。

So the boys stopped throwing stones and went away. / 因此男孩们不再扔石头并且离开了。
