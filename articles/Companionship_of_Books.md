A man may usually be known by the books he reads as well as by the friends he keeps; for there is a companionship of books as well as of men. One should always live with the best companions, whether it is of books or of men. / 通常看一个人读些什么书，观察他交的是什么样的朋友，就可以知道他的为人，因为有些人以书为伴，而有些人以人为伴。无论是以书为伴还是以人为伴，我们都应该选择最好的伴侣。

A good book may be like the best of your friend. It is the most patient and cheerful companion. It does not turn its back upon us in times of adversity or distress. It always receives us with the same kindness; amusing and instructing us in youth, and comforting and encouraging us in age. / 一本好书就像是你最好的朋友。它是我们最具耐心和最令人愉悦的伙伴。无论我们身处逆境，还是遭遇不幸，它都不会背弃我们。它总会一如既往地友好地接纳我们。我们年轻时，它给予我们欢乐并指导我们；我们年老时，它又给予我们慰藉并鼓励我们。

A good book is often the best urn of life which treasures the best that life could think out; for the world of a man's life is, for the most part, the world of his thoughts. Thus the best books are of good words and the golden thoughts, which, remembered and cherished, become our constant companions and comforters. / 一本好书常常像是记载生命的最好的瓮，蕴藏着人生思想的精华，因为思想在生活中占了很大的部分。因此，最好的书就是优美的辞藻和闪光的思想，需要我们铭记于心并且加以珍藏，成为我们永远的伴侣和慰藉者。

Books possess an essence of immortality. They are by far the most lasting products of human effort. The book is a living voice which men are still listening to. / 书籍拥有不朽的本质，它们是迄今为止人类努力创造的最为持久的产物。书是人类仍在聆听的最具活力的声音。
