We are all farmers. If we plant good seeds, we will reap a good harvest. if our seeds are poor, and there are a lot of grass seeds, the harvest will be useless crops. If we plant nothing at all, we will harvest nothing at all. / 我们都是农民。如果我们播下好的种子，我们将会获得丰收。如果我们播下的种子质量低劣，而且有很多的草籽，那么即使收获了也将会是无用的作物。如果我们什么也不播种，我们会一无所获。

We all want the future to be better than the past, but the future can go better itself. Don't cry because it is over, smile because it happened. In the past, we've learnt that life is tough, but we are tougher. We've learnt that we can't choose how we feel, but we can choose what about it. Failure doesn't mean you don't have success, it does mean you should achieve success in a different way. Failure doesn't mean you should give up, it does mean you must try harder. / 我们都希望未来能比过去更加美好，但是未来本身就能变得更好。不要因为结束而哭泣，要为曾经拥有而微笑。过去，我们知道人生不易，但是我们也更加坚强。我们知道我们无法选择如何去感受，但是我们能够选择与它相关的东西。失败并不意味着你不会拥有成功，而是意味着你应该用另一种方式去获得成功。失败并不意味着你应该放弃，而是意味着你必须更加努力。

The past has gone. Nothing can we do to change it, but the future is in front of us. From today on, let's be the owners of ourselves, and speak out, "we are the world, we are the future." / 过去的已经过去，我们无法改变，但是未来却在我们的前方。从今天起，让我们做自己的主人，并高声呐喊：“世界是我们的，未来是我们的。”
