We're like the cream. When the cream rises to the top, it separates itself from the milk. Perhaps that is what the New Age Movement is really all about. We find ourselves lonely at the top. / 我们就像奶油。当奶油浮到顶部的时候，它会和牛奶分离。也许这就是新世纪运动的真正含义。当我们高高在上时，我们就会感到孤独。

Often, we find ourselves difficult to find some individuals who are choosing the same way as ours. The way of humid and lazy is filled with other people to meet and talk to. The way of complainer is also full. The way of being safe, generic, and boring is so crowded that you almost cannot even move forward. Isn't that why you left that way? You had a need to move forward, a need for some elbowroom, a need to spread your arms wide, a need to be seen as special, unique, different. The masses may admire you, but they are not going to be able to really relate to you. You will be alone much of the time. / 我们经常发现自己很难找到一些与我们志同道合的人们。那条潮湿、慵懒的道路上挤满了可以相遇并且谈话的人。同时也充满了抱怨的人。那条安全，普通并且枯燥的道路是如此的拥挤，以至于你几乎无法向前迈进。这不正是你离开那条道路的原因吗？你需要向前迈进，需要一些活动的空间，需要伸展你的双臂，需要被认为是特别的，独一无二的，与众不同的。大家会仰慕你，但他们却不可能真正地融入你。大多数时间里，你将会是孤独的。

Do not be afraid of the loneliness. Do not force others to agree with you. Simply know that you are growing and that they are free to grow or not. It is the nature of the game. We are all free to choose our ways. / 不要害怕孤独。不必勉强其他人赞同你。坚定你自己的成长，不必管别人的意愿。这就是自然界的规则。我们都有选择自己道路的自由。
