If you have negative habits, failure is guaranteed for you unless you take the active decision to change your habits forever. Negative habits include overeating, gambling, smoking, drinking and so on. / 如果你有消极的习惯，那么你注定要失败，除非你主动决定，永远改掉这些习惯。消极的习惯包括暴饮暴食、赌博、吸烟、喝酒等。

We cannot forget those negative habits that are often the real causes of failure. These negative habits are character traits that will stop you from achieving success. I'm talking about mental habits such as waste of time, laziness, fear, shyness, lack of courage, etc. Waste of time is the worst negative habit. It is a dream killer. Instead of taking action and working hard to achieve the goal, it chooses to delay and to wait until tomorrow. However, when tomorrow becomes today, it still keeps delaying. The only solution to this problem is tostart taking action right now. / 我们不能忘记那些消极的习惯，它们通常会导致真正的失败。这些消极习惯关乎性格特点，可能会阻止你取得成功。我所说的是精神方面的习惯，例如浪费时间、懒惰、怯懦、害羞、缺乏勇气，等等。浪费时间是最糟糕的消极习惯。它是梦想的杀手。它不是采取行动，为达到目标而努力工作，反而一味地拖延，等待明日。然而，当明天变成了今天，它依旧在拖延。唯一的解决办法就是立刻行动起来。
