Swallows have gone, but they may come back again; willow trees have dried up, but they may be green again; peach blossoms have fallen, but they may bloom again. Now, you the wise, tell me, why would our days leave us but never return again? -- If they had been stolen by someone, then who could it be? Where could it hide them? If they had escaped themselves, then where could they now be? / 燕子去了，有再来的时候；杨柳枯了，有再青的时候；桃花谢了，有再开的时候。但是，聪明的，你告诉我，我们的日子为什么一去不复返呢？ -- 是有人偷了他们罢：那是谁？又藏在何处呢？是他们自己逃走了：现在又到了哪里呢？

I don't know how many days they have given me to spend, but I do feel my hands are gradually empty. Counting in silence, I find that more than eight thousand days have already slid away from me. Like a drop of water dripping from the point of a needle into the ocean, my days are disappearing into the stream of time, soundless and traceless. I can't help but be with sweat oozing from my forehead and tears running down from my face. / 我不知道他们给了我多少日子；但我的手确乎是渐渐空了。在默默里算着，八千多个日子已经从我手中溜去；像针尖上一滴水滴在大海里，我的日子滴在时间的流里，没有声音，也没有影子。我不禁头涔涔而泪潸潸了。
