If we really want to be happy, why do we act like a baby? / 如果我们真的想要高兴，为什么行为举止还像个小孩子？

We can actively set goals in our life and then go after what we want. But if we're always whining and complaining all the time, will we really live effectively? / 我们可以积极地制订生活的目标，然后追求我们想要的东西。但是如果我们整天都不停地抱怨、发牢骚，我们还能有效率地生活吗？

If you don't believe me, count how many times you complain in one day. Whether it is being stuck in traffic, or being bothered by the weather, there are endless instances where you can find a reason to complain. / 如果你不相信我，就算算你一天要抱怨几次。不管是因为陷入拥挤的交通，还是受到天气的困扰，总有无数件烦心事可以让你找到理由抱怨。

But it's not just outside circumstances that we complain about, we complain about ourselves too. We complain that we don't have enough time, we don't have enough money, and we're not smart enough, cool enough, and so on. / 我们不仅抱怨外部的环境，同时也抱怨我们自己。我们抱怨时间不够用，钱不够花，我们不够聪明、不够冷静，等等。

Imagine how happy you would be if you simply stopped complaining. Much of what you complain about is out of your control anyway. What's the point of complaining about something you have no power to change? When you recognize that you're complaining, stop it and ask yourself that... / 想象一下如果你停止抱怨的话你会变得多么快乐。你所抱怨的大多数事情都是你不能掌控的，那么抱怨那些你无力改变的事情又有什么意义呢？当你意识到自己在抱怨时，停下来吧，问问自己是想要快乐，还是继续抱怨。
