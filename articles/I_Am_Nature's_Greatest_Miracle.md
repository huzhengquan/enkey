I am nature's greatest miracle. / 我是自然界最伟大的奇迹。

I am not easily satisfied like the animals. Within me burns a flame, which has been passed from generations uncounted and its heat is constant irritation to my spirit to become better than I am. I will fan this flame of dissatisfaction and proclaim my uniqueness to the world. / 我并不像动物那样容易满足。我心中燃烧着一团火焰，它代代相传，不停地激励我要超越自己。我要将这团不甘心的火焰扇得更旺，向世界宣布我的独一无二和出类拔萃。

Neither will I be satisfied with yesterday's accomplishments nor will I indulge in self-praise for deeds which i n reality are too small to even acknowledge. I can accomplish far more than I have; why should the miracle which produced me end with my birth? Why cannot I extend that miracle to my deeds of today? / 我不再为昨日的成就而心满意足、沾沾自喜，也不再为微不足道的成绩自吹自擂。我能做的要比我已经拥有的多得多。为什么我要让自己的出生成为最后一样奇迹？为什么我不能再创造今天的奇迹？

I have been given eyes to see and a mind to think and now I know a great secret of life. I perceive that all my problems, discouragement, and heartaches are, in truth, great opportunities in disguise. I will no longer be fooled by the garments they wear for mine eyes are open. I will look beyond the cloth and I will not be deceived. / 我有眼睛，可以观察；我有头脑，可以思考。现在我已发觉了人生中的一个伟大的奥秘。我发现，一切难题、挫折与伤心，事实上都是乔装打扮的重大机遇。我不再被它们的外表所蒙骗，因为我已睁开双眼，看破了它们的伪装。
