level : 2
path : essay|lyric

Joy in life comes from having fine emotions, trusting them and then giving them the freedom as a bird flying in the sky. Joy in life can never be emerged as a pose or pretended from the outside of a mask. People who have this joy do not need to talk about it, because they radiate themselves. They live out their joy, letting it splash its light and glowing into other people's lives as naturally as a bird sings. / 生活的乐趣来源于拥有良好的情绪，信赖这些情绪，并给予它们自由，让它们如同鸟儿肆意翱翔于天空中。生活的乐趣无法用姿态表现出来，也无法靠面具来伪装。拥有这种乐趣的人们无需言语，他们自身就会散发出快乐的气息。他们自己生活在快乐当中，同时也让快乐发光，很自然地用这种快乐去感染他人，犹如鸟儿必定会唱歌一样。

We can never get joy by working for it directly. It comes, like happiness, to those who are going after something higher. It is a byproduct of great, simple life. The joy of life comes from what we put into life, not from what we seek to get from it. / 直接追求生活的乐趣反而不能得到它。与幸福一样，它也青睐于那些志存高远的人们。高雅而又简单的生活才能衍生出乐趣。它来源于我们对生活的投入，而非所求。
