When you have fallen into the bottom of your life, every people around you would tell you: Be hard-bitten and be happy! / 当你陷入人生低谷的时候，你身边的所有人都会告诉你：要坚强不屈服，而且要快乐！

To be hard-bitten would be necessary, but be happy? In this serious occasion, that would be too hard for you. After all, who could keep happy while he was head-broken and bleeding? / 坚强不屈服是必须的，但是快乐呢？在这种严峻的场合下，对你来说也许太难。毕竟，当被撞得头破血流时，谁还能保持愉悦的心情呢？

But you should at least keep calm, calmly facing and calmly treating. If you have obtained the calmness, no matter you are happy or unhappy, you have possessed the power for rebirth. / 但是你至少应该保持平静，平静地看待问题，并且平静地处理问题。如果你已经获得了平静，那么不管你高兴或不高兴，你都已经拥有了重生的力量。
