path : essay|sad

We have bigger houses, but smaller families; more convenience, but less time; more knowledge, but less judgment; more medicine, but less wellness. / 我们的房屋越来越宽敞，家庭却越来越小；生活越来越便捷，拥有的时间却越来越少；掌握的知识越来越多，判断力却越来越不准确；药物越来越多，健康却每况愈下。

We spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get angry too quickly, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too often, and pray too seldom. We have increased our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too little and lie too often. We've learned how to make a living, but not a life; we've added years to life, not life to years. / 我们花钱太盲目，笑得太少，开车太快，发怒太易，熬夜太晚，起床太累，书读得太少，电视看得太多，祈祷太少。我们不断增加物质财富，却减少了自身价值。我们说话太多，爱得太少，说谎太频繁。我们学会了如何谋生，却不懂得如何生活；我们延长了生命了期限，却没有让生活更有意义。

We have taller buildings, but shorter tempers; wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less; we buy more, but enjoy less. / 我们的住房越来越高，脾气却越来越糟；行驶的道路越来越宽，眼光却越来越窄。我们付出很多，却收获很少；我们购买了很多，却享受很少。

We've learned to rush, but not to wait; we have higher incomes, but lower morals. We have more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies, but have less communication. We are long on quantity, but short on quality. / 我们学会了追赶时间，却没学会耐心等待；我们的收入越来越多，道德品质却日益沦丧。我们生产出更多的电脑用于存储更多的信息，制作更多的副本，而彼此之间的交流却越来越少。我们拥有了数量，却缺乏质量。
