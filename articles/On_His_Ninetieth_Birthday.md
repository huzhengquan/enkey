In this symposium, better is it to only sit in silence. To express one's feelings as the end draws near is too intimate a task. That I would mention only one thought that comes to me as a listener-in: the riders in a race do not stop short when they reach the goal, there is a little finishing canter before coming to a standstill, there is time to hear the kind voice of friends, and to say to oneself, the work is done. But just as one says that, the answer comes, the race is over, but the work never is done while the power to work remains. The canter that brings you to a standstill need not be only coming to rest; it cannot be while you still live. But to live is to function, that is all there is in living. So I end with a land from a Latin voice: death, death, clutches my ear, and says, live, I am coming. / 在这个时刻，沉默是金。在生命即将结束时，要表达个人的感受并非一件容易的事。我想谈的只是作为一名倾听者的看法。骑手们并非一到终点就立该停止，而是继续缓慢前行，倾听朋友们的喝彩欢呼声，并告诉自己，行程结束了。正如人们所说的，结果出来了，比赛结束了，但只要前行的动力依然存在，人生就永远没有终点。到达终点后的慢跑并非意味着止步不前，因为只要活着便不能止步。活着就要有所成就，这才是生命意义之所在。最后谨以一句古老的拉丁格言与诸位共勉：死神不止，生命不止。
