Small as it is, the pen has changed the course of history, determined the destiny of nations, advanced the commerce of people, suppressed the elusive thoughts of man, recorded events, expressed news, and done more work for mankind than all other tools or weapons. / 笔虽然小，却改变了历史的进程，决定了民族的命运，促进了人们之间的贸易，抑制了难以捉摸的思想，记录事件，传递消息，为人类做出了比其他任何的工具或武器都多的工作。

Without it, progress would have been almost impossible. The invention of the wheel and screw, the introduction of steam-power, the use of electricity, which all have changed the lives of millions; but the pen has done more. It has created miracles It has prepared the way for all advancement. Whatever plans have been drawn up, whatever laws formulated, have come from the pen. / 没有它，进步几乎是件不可能的事情。车轮和螺丝的发明，蒸汽机的引入，电力的使用，所有这些都已经改变了亿万人民的生活；但是笔的贡献更多。它创造了奇迹。它为所有文明的进步铺平了道路。任何计划的草拟，任何法律的制定，全都出自于笔。
