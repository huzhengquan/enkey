path : essay|lyric

There are how many moments in life when you miss someone so much that you eagerly want to pull them from your dreams and hug them really! / 一生中有多少次这样的时刻：当我们对一个人朝思暮想时，我们急切地想把他们从梦中拉出来，真切地拥在怀中！

When one door to the happiness closes, another opens, but many times we wander so long a time at the closed door that we neglect the one which has been opened for us. / 通往幸福的一扇大门关闭了，会有另一扇幸福之门打开，但是曾有多少次，我们久久地徘徊在那扇已经关闭的门前，却忽略了那扇为我们开启的新的幸福之门。

Don't go for good appearances, because they may cheat you. Don't go for luxurious wealth, because it may fade away. Go for someone who can make you smile, because it takes only a smile to make a dark day birght. Find the one that can make your heart smile. / 不要追求华丽的外表，它们可能会欺骗你；不要追逐奢华的财富，它们可能会慢慢消失。你应当去寻找那个可以让你微笑的人，因为仅仅一个微笑就可以令暗淡的日子豁然开朗。去找寻那个令你的心灵微笑的人吧！

May you have enough happiness to make you lovely, enough attempts to make you strong, enough sadness to make you a man, enough hope to make you happy. / 愿你拥有足够的幸福，使你亲切可爱；愿你经历种种磨难，使你勇敢坚强；愿你遭受足够的惨痛，使你心胸豁达；愿你生活中充满希望，使你快乐永久。

The happiest people in the world don't certainly have the best of everything; they just make the best use of everything that comes along and you can't live a better life until you leave hold of your past failures and pains. / 世界上最幸福的人并不一定能拥有最美好的东西，他们只是最充分地利用了他们生命中的一切罢了。最灿烂的明天常常建立在对过去的遗忘之上，只有忘却了过去的种种失败与伤痛，才能迎来更美好的生活。
