Though there is much to be worried about, there is far more for which to be thankful. Though life's goodness can sometimes be overshadowed, it is never surpassed. / 尽管有太多的事情让人忧虑，但有更多的事情值得我们感激。尽管生命的美好有时会被蒙上阴影，但它永远不会被超越。

The goodness of life cannot be denied. In the most magnificent prospect and in the smallest details, look care fully, for goodness always comes with shining. / 生命的美好无法否认。在最壮观的前景和最微小的细节当中，一定要仔细观察，因为美好的事物总是会华丽登场。

There is no limit to the goodness of life. It grows more abundant with each new encounter. The more you experience and appreciate the goodness of life, the more it will be. Even when the cold winds blow and the world seems to be covered with foggy shadows, the goodness of life still lives on. Open your eyes, open your heart, and you will see that goodness is everywhere. / 生命的美好设有界限。每一次新的邂逅都会使它变得更加丰富。你经历得越多，越能欣赏到生命的美好，这种美好也就会变得越来越多。即使当寒风呼啸，整个世界似乎被笼罩在雾气之中时，生命的美好依然存在。睁开双眼，打开心扉，你就会发现美好无处不在。

Take some time to let the goodness of life touch your spirit and relax your thoughts. Then, share your good fortune with other people, for the goodness of life grows more and more magnificent each time it is given away. Though the problems always catch your attention and the conficts appear to be even stronger, the goodness of life grows stronger still, quietly, ppeacefully, with more purposes and meanings than ever before. / 花些时间让生命的美好触动你的灵魂，放松你的思绪。然后，与他人分享你的幸运，因为每次被给予时，生命的美好总会变得越来越壮观。尽管总有一些问题让你费神，冲突也似乎愈加强烈，但生命的美好却总是安静地、平和地变得更加强大，比以往拥有更强的意志力和更多的含义。
